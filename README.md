## Project Summary

An enhancement and continuation of the existing Silver Buckle Youth Equestrian Center (SBYEC) WordPress website, improving event management, usability, and maintainability for non-technical staff.

### Additional information about the project

## Sprint 2 – Progress Update

### Overview
During **Sprint 2**, our main focus was to complete all of the client’s required features and improve the website’s usability for non-technical staff.  
We prioritized stability and client-driven changes over new experimental features to ensure the website can be easily maintained and updated.

### Key Improvements
| Area | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Event Calendar** | Replaced the outdated static calendar with a **dynamic event list** powered by *The Events Calendar* plugin. Each event now includes images, description, date, time, ticket price, organizer, phone, email, and address. Events can be easily created or edited through the WordPress backend. |
| **Lesson Pages** | Updated **Rising Stars**, **Private Lessons**, and **Group Lessons** pages with richer visual content, including sample photos and embedded YouTube videos. Added test event lists for demonstration purposes. |
| **Equine Boarding & Mission Pages** | Added more photos and short videos to enhance user trust and visual appeal. These demonstrate the organization’s professional care for horses and its community mission. |
| **Client Tutorials** | Created detailed step-by-step tutorials (with screenshots) to teach SBYEC staff how to: 1) add new events, 2) edit existing events, and 3) update team members. These guides ensure long-term site maintainability. |
| **Content Structure** | Retained legacy items such as “Scholarships,” “Login,” and “Sign Up” until further client confirmation. Added a separate **All Events** page instead of replacing old content to avoid interrupting live site operations. |
| **Backend Optimization** | Simplified event-editing workflow with intuitive date/time selectors, organizer fields, and category tags. Ensured that all forms remain HTTPS-secured. |

### Challenges
Communication with the client remained the main challenge.  
Feedback on Sprint 1 changes arrived slowly, which delayed some planned updates and limited new content uploads (photos, videos, and course descriptions).  
To avoid disrupting the live site, all structural changes were made cautiously and only after receiving approval.

### Reflections
Although some media content is still missing, the overall direction and design are now aligned with the client’s vision.  
The new event list and improved page visuals significantly enhance usability and site freshness.  
Once the client provides updated course materials, the website can be quickly finalized with minimal additional work.

### Next Steps (Sprint 3 Preview)
With most mandatory tasks completed, **Sprint 3** will focus on:  
- Implementing the **custom AI chatbot** and integrating it into the website.  
- Finalizing all client tutorial materials.  
- Uploading final demo videos and documentation.
