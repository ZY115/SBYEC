# SBYEC Website Enhancement

## Project Summary

An enhancement and continuation of the existing Silver Buckle Youth Equestrian Center (SBYEC) WordPress website, improving event management, usability, and maintainability for non-technical staff.

### Additional information about the project
This project continues the work of a previous WSU student team.  
The **SBYEC Website Enhancement Project** focuses on completing unfinished features, optimizing existing modules, and ensuring that SBYEC staff can independently manage and update their website.  

Key goals include:
- Restoring and upgrading the **event calendar** with Zeffy integration.  
- Completing the **lesson subpages** (Rising Stars, Private Lessons, Group Lessons).  
- Simplifying **staff content updates** via WordPress backend.  
- Improving **social media embedding**, **accessibility**, and **security (HTTPS)**.  

All development work builds upon the **existing WordPress database, content, and structure** inherited from the previous project team.
