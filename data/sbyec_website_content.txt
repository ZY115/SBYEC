Riding Lessons
Building Confidence, One Ride at a Time
Silver Buckle provides structured riding lessons for all ages and skill levels, following our Levels-Based Riding Curriculum. All new riders begin with private lessons for at least one month to build foundational skills and confidence. Lessons integrate both groundwork and riding techniques, available in English or Western styles, emphasizing safety, horsemanship, and understanding the “why” behind each technique.
Private lessons
offer personalized, one-on-one instruction tailored to individual goals and skill levels. These sessions provide intensive guidance on groundwork and riding, ensuring steady progression. Each lesson lasts roughly 45 minutes and costs $75 with select instructors, setting riders up for success and confidence before transitioning to group classes.
After demonstrating adequate control and awareness in private lessons, riders advance to
group lessons
. These weekly sessions promote bonding with peers and foster independence in riders who have acquired foundational equine skills. Typically, groups consist of 3-4 riders, priced at $55 per session and billed monthly.
Designed specifically for young equestrians aged 4-9, the
Rising Stars Class
introduces essential horse skills in a safe and supportive environment. These 30-minute lessons occur exclusively on Thursday evenings at $40 per session, guided by an instructor and assisted by volunteers, preparing young riders for future advancement within our program.

Volunteer Opportunities
Galloping Together, Making a Difference
Thank you for your interest in our Adult Volunteer Program.

We have several volunteer paths that depend on your area of interest and horse experience. We are most in need of volunteers for:

Please know that our volunteers do NOT ride horses; our horses get plenty of exercise and schooling by our paid staff and lesson students.
Growing Together, Caring for Horses
Youth 15 to 17 years of age are eligible to participate in our Youth Volunteer Program which is primarily barn chores and pasture cleaning. Youth volunteers work under the direction of one of our staff members but must have basic horse safety skills and be able to work independently. Please know that our volunteers do NOT ride horses; our horses get plenty of exercise and schooling by our paid staff and lesson students.
Participate in one of our
Volunteer Day

Our Mission
“Our mission is to positively impact lives through equine-related activities
“
Our Vision
Silver Buckle Youth Equestrian Center will help teach every young person to find self-confidence, learn responsibilities, gain trust and know compassion through the connection with a horse.
Our Values
Responsibility
Empathy
Continuous learning
Respect
Embrace Change
Integrity
Our Story
Founded in 1977 as the Silver Buckle Rodeo Club, our Center began as a working rodeo program aimed at providing Clark County youth a safe place to grow.  Staying aware of changing times and needs in our community, we became the Silver Buckle Youth Equestrian Center, expanding our mission beyond our partnership with local criminal justice programs.
Keeping Our Mission Alive
Today we proudly retain the original Silver Buckle name, even though we moved away from our rodeo roots.  The idea of a “buckle” describes our journey:  we strive to connect past traditions of hard work, hands-on learning, and structured dependability; to now helping young people develop job skills and self-respect while embracing Natural Horsemanship and Emotional Intelligence to use outside the ranch gates.
Through the years, we remained consistent in our mission to help support youth in becoming successful, independent adults through various equine activities, both riding and non-riding.  These first-hand experiences with horses grow their confidence, self-esteem and empathy for others.  While caring for animals through non-verbal communication, our youth learn about themselves, how to interact positively with others and live a rich full life that respects all other living creatures while remaining true to their unique self.
